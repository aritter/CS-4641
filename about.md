Mondays, Wednesdays 2:00-3:15pm

## Textbook(s)

There are two excellent NLP textbooks that are freely available online. I will assign readings from both - there is a lot of value in seeing multiple perspectives on the same material. If a concept you encounter seems confusing at first, try reading about it in the other book to get a different perspective.

- [Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. Speech and Language Processing (3rd Edition)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)
- [Jacob Eisenstein Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf)
- There will be other assigned readings as well.

## Prerequisites

The course will involve a lot of math and programming.  To succeed, you will need a strong programming background.  You should be comfortable working with Python, or have the ability to learn a new programming language very quickly.  The course also assumes mastery of basic concepts in probability and multivariable calculus.  A prior Machine Learning course would be very helpful,
but is not required.

## Assignments / Grading

Graded work will include both written and programming assignments. All assignments should be submitted to Gradescope by 11:59pm on the day it is due.  Each student will have 3 flexible days to turn in late homework throughout the semester. As an example, you could turn in the first homework 2 days late and the second homework 1 day late without any penalty. After that you will loose 20% for each day the homework is late. Please email your homework to the instructor in case there are any technical issues with submission.

### Programming Assignments (Projects) - 40%

There will be three programming assignments where you get hands-on experience implementing algorithms that are discussed in class.  The assignments will be in Python, and make use of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).  The assignments will require a non-trivial amount of computation time to complete, we are designing them to be completed using Google's [Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/) platform which provides free access to GPUs.  Completing the assignments will require some computation time, even with an efficient implementation, so we strongly recommend starting work on the programming projects well in advance of the deadline.  If you start working on an assignment the day before it is due, it is unlikely you will be able to complete it on time.

### Written Assignments (Problem Sets) - 20%

The written assignments will mostly be mathematical.  You can write your answers on paper and then scan and upload them to Gradescope.  Please write your answers clearly - if we are not able to read
them, we won't be able to give credit.

### Midterm Exam - 20%

The midterm will be similar in format to the written assignments (problem sets), but will be more substantial.

### Final Project - 20%

The final project is an open-ended assignment, with the goal of gaining experience applying the techniques presented in class to real-world datasets. Students should work in groups of 2-4. It is a good idea to discuss your planned project with the instructor to get feedback. The final project report should be 4 pages. The report should describe the problem you are solving, what data is being used, the proposed technique you are applying in addition to what baseline is used to compare against.

## Academic Integrity

Any assignment or exam that you hand in must be your own work (with the exception of group projects). However, talking with others to better understand the material is strongly encouraged. Copying a solution or letting someone copy your solution is considered cheating. Everything you hand in must be your own words. Code you hand in must be written by you, with the exception of any code provided as part of the assignment. Any collaboration during an exam is considered cheating. Any student who is caught cheating will be reported to the Office of Student Integrity. Please don't take a chance - if you are having trouble understanding the material, let us know and we will be happy to help.
