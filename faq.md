## Q: Can you sign an override form, so I can register for the course?
- A: No, unfortunately we can't accomidate students who do not meet the requirement to register.  Please consult with your academic advisor if you have further questions.

## Q: The class is full, can I get in?
- A: The class has a waitlist, so we can't gaurantee whether or not you will be able to enroll.  If you plan to stay on the waitlist, we recommend that you attend class and complete the homework assignments.

## Q: I am registered, but not able to attend in person.  Is it still possible to take the class?
- A: We are planning to broadcast the lectures on BlueJeans, and all graded coursework will be submitted online, so in theory this should be possible.   However, we can't gaurantee all the lectures will be available online, in the unlikely event of technical difficulties, etc.

## Q: I have a question, how can I contact the course staff?
