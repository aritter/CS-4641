## Q: Can you sign an override form, so I can register for the course?
- A: No, unfortunately we can't accomidate students who do not meet the official requirements to register for the course.

## Q: The class is full, can I get in?
- A: The class has a waitlist, so we can't gaurantee whether or not you will be able to enroll.  If you do plan to stay on the waitlist, we recommend that you attend class and complete the homework assignments, in case you are able to enroll in the class.

## Q: I am registered, but not able to attend in person.  Is it still possible to take the class?
- A: We are planning to broadcast the lectures using BlueJeans, and graded coursework will be submitted online, so this should be possible.

## Q: I have a question, how can I contact the course staff?
- A: The best place to try first is [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/krjfpfjr3es38i).  If it is a question that may apply to others as well, please ask publicly so that everyone can benefit from the answer.
